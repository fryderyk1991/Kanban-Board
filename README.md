 # Kanban-Board
I would like to present you live version of [Kanban-Board](link)

This is a simple implementation of a Kanban Board, a tool that helps visualize and manage work. Originally it was first created in Toyota automotive, but nowadays it's widely used in software development.

A Kanban Board is usually made of 3 columns - TO DO, IN PROGRESS and COMPLETED. 
In my case in task container on the top is the name of the task and under line u can see the author of current task. Every column has a limit of tasks like it should be.
I created my own hook here - useStorage. That is responsible for save data to localStorage.
